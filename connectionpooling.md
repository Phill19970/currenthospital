# Connection Pooling in Java

## What is Connection Pooling?

Connection pooling is a technique used to improve performance in applications that need to connect to a database. Instead of establishing a new database connection each time an application needs to talk to the database, the application retrieves a connection from a pool of connections that have already been established, uses it to interact with the database, and then returns it to the pool.

## Why is Connection Pooling Needed?

Establishing a connection to a database can be a time-consuming operation. If an application establishes a new connection each time it needs to execute a SQL statement, it can spend more time establishing connections than executing SQL statements. By reusing existing connections, connection pooling can significantly improve the performance of the application.

### Advantages of Connection Pooling

Improved Performance: Connection pooling can significantly improve the performance of the application by reusing existing connections.

Scalability: Connection pooling allows an application to support more concurrent users by sharing a fixed number of database connections among all the users.

Resource Optimization: Connection pooling allows the resources associated with a database connection (such as network sockets and database cursors) to be reused, which can help to reduce the resource usage of the application.

### Disadvantages of Connection Pooling

Complexity: Connection pooling can add complexity to the application. The application needs to manage the pool of connections, including handling failed connections and preventing connection leaks.

Stale Connections: Connections in the pool can become stale if the database server is restarted or if the network connection between the application and the database server is lost.

Resource Consumption: While connection pooling can help to reduce the resource usage of the application, it can also lead to resource consumption issues if the size of the pool is not managed correctly. If the pool is too large, it can consume a lot of resources. If the pool is too small, it can become a bottleneck.

## Connection Pooling with HikariCP

HikariCP is a lightweight and highly optimized Java library for connection pooling. It is known for its simplicity, speed, and reliability. It has a very simple API, does not require any configuration (although it is highly configurable), and can significantly improve the performance of any application that needs to connect to a database.

To use HikariCP, you simply create a HikariDataSource with the necessary configuration (such as the JDBC URL, username, and password), and then call getConnection on the HikariDataSource whenever you need to interact with the database. When you're done with the connection, you call close on the connection to return it to the pool.
