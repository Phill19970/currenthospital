# A and B

Approach (a) is simpler and more encapsulated, making it easy to use and safe from misuse. It's more ideal for simple queries.

Approach (b) provides more flexibility, allowing for complex parameter setting. However, it exposes internal state, risking misuse. It's suitable for complex queries.

## DataSource and DriverManager

DataSource and DriverManager are both used to establish a connection with a database, but they differ in their capabilities:

DataSource: This is the preferred way to establish a connection. It's part of the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) API, allowing for a more robust architecture. It supports connection pooling, making it more efficient for applications that open and close connections frequently.

DriverManager: This is an older approach and is part of the JDBC API. It doesn't support connection pooling, making it less efficient for frequent open/close operations.

DataSource is generally more efficient and flexible than DriverManager, but it might be more complex to set up.
